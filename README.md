# Band Excitation ML Analysis for Ferroelectric Switching

## Repository Overview

This repository explores ferroelectric switching behavior in thin-film materials using Band Excitation Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (BE-PFM) data. Through a combination of machine learning models, visual analysis, and theoretical discussion, the aim is to understand the key physical features that influence polarization switching in Pb(Zr,Ti)Oâ‚ƒ.

The repository contains:

- ðŸ“˜ A whitepaper detailing the methodology and results  
- ðŸ“Š Static visualizations for initial data exploration  
- ðŸ¤– A Jupyter notebook implementing machine learning workflows

---

## Project Objectives

- **Analyze** high-dimensional BE-PFM data collected from a 60Ã—60 pixel grid over 96 voltage steps
- **Extract and recalculate** physical fit parameters: amplitude (A), phase (Ï•), resonance frequency (Ï‰), and quality factor (Q)
- **Apply machine learning** to identify trends and features correlated with ferroelectric domain switching
- **Present findings** through visualizations and a  whitepaper
